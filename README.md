# Social Network-ACM

This task is about build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. You’ll use Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. In addition to using the Express.js (Links to an external site.) and Mongoose (Links to an external site.) packages, you may also optionally use a JavaScript date library of your choice or the native JavaScript Date object to format timestamps.



Second, create HTML file and added Bootstrap, doing more research about how to use and get more information on:

https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.4/css/

Start work with JavaScript,  Added the variables to be used and found the best way to accomplish it
I found a lot information online, some of them is:

Then My logic is to create a question and complete the rest of the requests for this evaluation:![Screenshot 2021-11-14 at 12 24 37 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91921941/141691521-c3a8058e-6644-4d3d-a227-43871ae319d8.png)

and create the algorithm for the assignment added time counted, storage high score, and added my "SECRET PLAYER"
